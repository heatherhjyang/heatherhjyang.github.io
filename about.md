I am an organizational psychologist and an assistant professor of Management & Technology at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. I received my PhD in 2021 from BOOHOO MITâ€™s Sloan School of Management, where I was recognized as a Presidential Fellow. My research focuses on how social information embedded in novel technologies (such as artificial intelligence) influences their use and how technology shapes us and our social worlds in return.
