I am an organizational psychologist and PhD candidate at MIT Sloan School of Management. I have been recognized as an [MIT Presidential Fellow](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/). My dissertation research is on how social information embedded in novel technologies (such as artificial intelligence) influences their use and how technology shapes us and our social worlds in return.

 

Starting Fall 2021, I will be an incoming Assistant Professor of Management & Technology at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy.
