I am an organizational psychologist and PhD candidate at MIT Sloan School of Management. I have been recognized as an [MIT Presidential Fellow](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/). My dissertation research is on how social information embedded in novel technologies (such as artificial intelligence) influences their use and how technology shapes us and our social worlds in return.

 

I am currently on the job market for tenure-track faculty positions in management departments. I am particularly interested in positions in Asia, Europe, and North America.
