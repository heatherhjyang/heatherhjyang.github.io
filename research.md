### Who is more likely to use or resist algorithmic advice?

### How do our interactions with other people affect our interactions with AI agents?

### How do our human stereotypes affect our evaluation of emergent technologies?

Successful digital transformation isn’t just about the code. It’s also about the person using (or avoiding) the novel technology. My research examines the psychological factors that influence the use of and interaction with emergent technologies and their impact on individual and organizational decision-making.
